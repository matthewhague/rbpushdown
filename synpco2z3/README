Q: What is synpco2z3?
A: It is a tool for doing synchronisation-bounded and reversal-bounded
   analysis of concurrent programs with numeric data types. The tool is
   based on the technique presented in the CAV'12 paper:

        http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/v1awidja/papers/cav12-long.pdf

USAGE
-----

This document gives a brief description of how to use synpco2z3. 

System requirements: 
- SWI-Prolog (at least version 5.10)
- Z3 SMT-Solver

How to use:
- invoke swi-prolog
- query '[call].' (this invokes all the predicates of synpco2z3)
- to test the correct version of producer consumer example (from wiki) with 
  reversal parameter 1 and context switch parameter 2, invoke 'mycall6'.
- to test the correct version of producer consumer example (from wiki) with 
  reversal parameter 1 and context switch parameter 2, invoke 'mycall3'.
- the output formula is produced in output.txm


How to create your own synpco in synpco2z3:
- see the definitions of the predicates synpco_example_prod_cons and mycall3
  the file call.pl
- see the definitions of the predicates synpco_example_prod_cons_corr and 
  mycall6 the file call.pl

Files:
- call.pl   - Main file containing wrapper functionalities
- synpco.pl - file that implements synchronous pushdown with counters
- pds.pl    - file that implements pushdown automata
- cg.pl     - file that implements context-free grammars
- tree.pl   - file that implements static trees
- output.txt- output formula to be fed into Z3
